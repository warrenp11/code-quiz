# Code Quiz

# Description
This coding quiz was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. I was required to create a timed coding quiz that randomly asked the user questions and met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria).

This application was written from scratch, no base code was provided.
