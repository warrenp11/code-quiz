# Code Quiz

# Description
This coding quiz was designed as a homework assignment for Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. I was required to create a timed coding quiz that randomly asked the user questions and met all of the acceptance criteria (see Acceptance Criteria).

This application was written from scratch, no base code was provided.

# Installation
No installation required. (see Websites below) 
# Instructions
1. On the home page, click "Start Quiz"

    * If a question is answered correctly, 1 point will be added to your score
    * If a question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds will be deducted from your time
3. When all questions are answered, or the time reaches 0, the quiz is over
